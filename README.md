# raspi-config
Configuration tool for the Raspberry Pi

All I did was add Raspberry Pi 4 overclock options

Note: all overclocking is at your own risk. Be careful.

# if system crashes after overclocking, hold shift during boot
# then, run this tool again and set a different preset or disable completely
